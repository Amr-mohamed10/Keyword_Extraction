## Overview

The code in this repository focuses on extracting keywords from text using different NLP techniques. It includes implementations for TF-IDF feature extraction and Word2Vec modeling. The extracted keywords can be used for various text analysis tasks, such as document classification, information retrieval, and content summarization.

## Installation

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/keyword-extraction.git
   cd keyword-extraction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them:

   `````bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the code:

   ````bash
   python keyword_extraction.py
   ```

   Make sure to provide the necessary inputs, such as the training data and query terms, as mentioned in the code comments.

## Usage

The code provides different approaches for keyword extraction:

- TF-IDF Feature Extraction: This approach utilizes the TF-IDF vectorizer from scikit-learn to extract features from the text. It calculates the cosine similarity between a query and the article features to identify relevant articles and extract keywords from them.

- Word2Vec Modeling: This approach trains a Word2Vec model using the preprocessed text. It calculates the cosine similarity between a query and the article embeddings obtained from the Word2Vec model to identify relevant articles and extract keywords from them.

To use the code, you need to provide the necessary inputs, such as the training data and query terms, in the appropriate sections of the code.

## Examples

The code includes example usages for both the TF-IDF approach and the Word2Vec approach. These examples demonstrate how to extract keywords given a query and a list of terms. The extracted keywords are sorted by frequency and displayed in the console.

To run the examples, make sure to provide the required inputs and uncomment the corresponding sections in the code.
